## Practiced React and Tailwind CSS

This project was very beneficial for developing React skills. I learned a lot about components, state, props, event listeners, useEffect, and useful functions. I also used tailwind CSS for the first time! 

I followed the first half of the video linked below while doing the project. It really helped me understand the logic behind react's structure and function.
